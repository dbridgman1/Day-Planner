# Day Planner

## Description

This application is a simple calender that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day.  If the time of day has already passed color of time block will be gray.  If its the same time of time the color will be red and if time block has yet to come the color will be green.  This application focuses on the use of HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  The application also uses Moment.js to calculate the date and time of day.
 


## Developer 

This is the first application I have created with jQuery.  I definitely enjoy using it rather than coding using vanilla JavaScript.  Inside my Javascript file I do feel like theres a lot of repeated code that can be cleaned up a bit but all and all the application functions pretty well.
